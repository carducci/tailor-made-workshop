## Motivation

[Review your requirements documentation - Discuss system capabilities and how they are driven by business requirements. Include supporting references (people, documents, etc.)]

## Description

[Describe the constraint at a high-level. Consider including diagrams. What does this mean for implementation teams?]

* [option 1]
* [option 2]
* [option 3]
* … <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

### Outcome <!-- optional -->

* [e.g., improvement of capability satisfaction, related constraints, what this means long-term…]
* …

### Trade-offs <!-- optional -->

* [e.g., compromising capability, balanced/offset by constraint, …]
